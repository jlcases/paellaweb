Welcome to PAELLADOC. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Our Commitment to Privacy:** We value your privacy. This site is designed to share information about the PAELLADOC project with minimal data collection. We do not use tracking cookies or collect personal identification information unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., by contacting us directly).

## Collection of Your Information

Given our hosting on GitHub Pages and our commitment to privacy, the information collected is minimal:

### Personal Data

We do **not** actively collect personal data like your name or email address just by visiting the site. If you choose to contact us via email or through GitHub Discussions, we will naturally receive the information you provide in that communication.

### Derivative Data (GitHub Pages)

GitHub Pages may collect standard web server log information, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and pages visited. This data is used by GitHub for security and operational purposes of the GitHub Pages service. We, as PAELLADOC, do not directly access or process this raw log data for tracking or analysis.

### Cookies

This website does **not** use cookies for tracking or analytics.

## Use of Your Information

Any information collected (primarily server logs by GitHub Pages, or direct contact information) is used solely for:

- Operating and maintaining the security of the website (by GitHub).
- Responding to your direct inquiries if you contact us.

We do **not** use your information for marketing, profiling, or sharing with third-party advertisers.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties, except as required by law or for the essential operation of the site via GitHub Pages.

## Security of Your Information

We rely on the security measures implemented by GitHub Pages for hosting. While no online service is 100% secure, we strive to use platforms with strong security practices.

## Policy for Children

This website is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from them.
