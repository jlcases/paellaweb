# AI-First Philosophy

PAELLADOC's AI-First philosophy represents a fundamental shift in how we approach software development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Context is Everything

- **Preservation**: Every decision, discussion, and design choice is preserved
- **Accessibility**: Context is structured for both human and AI consumption
- **Continuity**: Context flows naturally through the development lifecycle

### 2. AI as a Team Member

- **Collaboration**: AI is treated as a first-class development team member
- **Communication**: Development artifacts are structured for optimal AI interaction
- **Augmentation**: AI enhances rather than replaces human capabilities

### 3. Structured Knowledge

- **MECE Organization**: Information is organized without gaps or overlaps
- **Semantic Structure**: Documentation follows patterns that AI can effectively process
- **Linked Context**: Related information is explicitly connected

## Practical Implementation

### Documentation First

- Start with clear documentation of intentions and requirements
- Use structured templates that capture complete context
- Maintain living documentation that evolves with the project

### Continuous AI Integration

- Leverage AI throughout the development process
- Use AI for code generation, review, and optimization
- Maintain feedback loops between documentation and implementation

### Context Preservation

- Record decision rationale and alternatives considered
- Maintain traceability between requirements and implementation
- Preserve project history in an AI-accessible format
