# Core Concepts

PAELLADOC is built on several fundamental concepts that work together to create a robust development framework.

## AI-First Development

AI-First Development is not just about using AI tools - it's about designing your entire development process with AI collaboration in mind. This includes:

- **Context Preservation**: Ensuring AI understands the full context of your project
- **Structured Communication**: Using templates and patterns that AI can effectively process
- **Iterative Refinement**: Leveraging AI for continuous improvement of code and documentation

## MECE Documentation

Our documentation follows the MECE principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive):

- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each piece of information has its specific place
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All necessary information is captured
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Information is structured in logical levels

## Development Exoskeleton

PAELLADOC acts as a development exoskeleton by:

- **Augmenting Capabilities**: Enhancing developer productivity with AI
- **Maintaining Structure**: Providing a framework for consistent development
- **Preserving Context**: Ensuring knowledge is maintained throughout the project lifecycle

## Continuous Documentation

Documentation is treated as a living artifact that:

- **Evolves with Code**: Updates automatically as code changes
- **Maintains History**: Preserves decision-making context
- **Guides Development**: Serves as a blueprint for implementation
