    <h1>The Context Loss Problem</h1>
    <p>AI development teams face unique documentation challenges</p>

    <h2>What is Context Loss?</h2>
    <p>Context loss in AI development occurs when critical information about a project's decisions, architectures, and learnings becomes unavailable to team members who need it. This happens due to poor documentation practices, knowledge silos, and inadequate knowledge transfer processes.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Signs of Context Loss</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Repeated questions</strong> - Team members asking the same questions repeatedly</li>
      <li><strong>Decision amnesia</strong> - No one remembers why certain technical choices were made</li>
      <li><strong>Reinventing solutions</strong> - Solving problems that have already been solved</li>
      <li><strong>Onboarding challenges</strong> - New team members taking too long to become productive</li>
      <li><strong>Knowledge bottlenecks</strong> - One person becoming the "oracle" for all project questions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Cost of Context Loss</h3>
    <div class="problem-solution">
      <div class="problem-card">
        <h4>Productivity Impact</h4>
        <p>Teams spend up to 30% of their time searching for information or recreating existing knowledge.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem-card">
        <h4>Quality Impact</h4>
        <p>Without proper context, developers make suboptimal decisions that can introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem-solution">
      <div class="problem-card">
        <h4>Collaboration Impact</h4>
        <p>Knowledge silos prevent effective collaboration and create dependencies on specific team members.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="problem-card">
        <h4>Innovation Impact</h4>
        <p>When teams constantly reinvent solutions to solved problems, they have less time for true innovation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Why AI Development Is Especially Vulnerable</h3>
    <p>AI development faces unique documentation challenges compared to traditional software development:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Experimental nature</strong> - Multiple approaches are tested before finding the right solution</li>
      <li><strong>Complex dependencies</strong> - Intricate relationships between data, models, and infrastructure</li>
      <li><strong>Rapid evolution</strong> - Fast-changing technologies and frameworks</li>
      <li><strong>Interdisciplinary teams</strong> - Different backgrounds and terminology</li>
      <li><strong>Non-deterministic outcomes</strong> - Results that can be difficult to reproduce exactly</li>
    </ul>
