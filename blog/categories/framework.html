## Introduction conceptual
AI-First Development represents a paradigm shift in how we approach software creation in the AI era. Unlike traditional methodologies that treat AI as a tool, AI-First Development recognizes the need for a completely new framework that prioritizes context preservation, intent-driven architecture, and collaborative consciousness between humans and AI. This category explores the philosophical foundations and practical implementations of this revolutionary approach to building sustainable AI systems.
