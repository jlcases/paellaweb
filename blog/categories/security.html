## Introduction conceptual
As AI systems become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, security concerns have emerged as a critical consideration. This category explores the unique security challenges associated with AI-assisted development, from direct vulnerabilities in AI-generated code to more subtle issues like context loss and implicit assumptions. We examine methodologies for identifying, mitigating, and preventing security risks in AI-first projects, ensuring that the productivity gains of AI don't come at the expense of system integrity and data protection.
